    <h1>Building a pinhole camera</h1>

      <p>
        This is the exciting story of how we built a pinhole camera, took touristy pictures, and learned about photography.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started off in the Cory makerspace. That's where we found all of the things we'd need to build a miniature dark room:
        <center>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/IMG_1332.JPG" style="width:400px; height=auto">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/IMG_1361.JPG" style="width:400px; height=auto">
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </center>
      </p>

      <p>
        It took a fair amount of measuring and marking, as well as some poking and padding, but we successfully assembled our box. Here it is:
        <center>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/p1.jpg" style="width:300px; height=auto">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/p3.jpg" style="width:300px; height=auto">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/p4.jpg" style="width:300px; height=auto">
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </center>

        At this point we should note that James Chang graciously donated his Canon EOS-M to us, and that we couldn't have done this project without it. We feel a little guilty about putting it in so many precarious positions. Sorry James!
      </p>
      <p>One further note: we used ImageMagick to transpose our images but we haven't done any other post-processing on the images you're about to see.

      <p>
        We needed to find a <i>really dark</i> room to try light painting. My closet was perfect for the job. Here's what it looked like when lit (left), and with the lights turned out (right).
        <center>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/p6.jpg" style="width:300px; height=auto">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/p7.jpg" style="width:300px; height=auto">
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </center>
      </p>

      <p>
        It was pretty spooky in there but I didn't let it get to me. Fearlessly, I started painting with light:
        <center>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/IMG_1451.JPG" style="width:500px; height=auto">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/IMG_1449.JPG" style="width:500px; height=auto">
            </tr>
            <tr>
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/IMG_1452.JPG" style="width:500px; height=auto">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="pix/IMG_1454.JPG" style="width:500px; height=auto">
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </center>
      </p>
      <p>Here we see a loop, the symbol for existential quantifiers, a collection of sine waves, and the letter V (in clockwise order). Unfortunately, I couldn't manage anything much more complicated because it's hard to draw transposed pictures in a cramped space. I'm glad that we got really crisp light paintings though.</p>
      <p>Note: The top-right image is brighter than the other three because it was intentionally overexposed (with a higher ISO sensitivity and wider aperture). This causes an interesting blurring effect, effectively widening my light paintbrush (read: iPhone flashlight).</p>

    <div>
      <h3 id="l6">Memorable scenes</h3>

      <p>
        This is the first scene we captured (top), and what it's actually supposed to look like (bottom).
        <center>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>

            </tr>

        We had to make some serious sacrifices to take the following two pictures. On the left we see North Gate: we mounted the camera on top of two trash cans to get this shot, which was a very smelly ordeal. On the right is a picture from the west side of campus: we had to climb on top of a parking kiosk to mount the camera.
